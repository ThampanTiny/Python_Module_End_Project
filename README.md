# DSML - Python Module End Project 
The dataset from ABC company, consists of 458 rows and 9 columns. The company requires a comprehensive report detailing information about their employees across various teams. My tasks include preprocessing the dataset, analyzing the data, and presenting my findings graphically.

Analysis Tasks:

Determine the distribution of employees across each team and calculate the percentage split relative to the total number of employees.
Segregate employees based on their positions within the company.
Identify the predominant age group among employees.
Discover which team and position have the highest salary expenditure.
Investigate if there's any correlation between age and salary, and represent it visually.
Preprocessing: The Height for employees were in wrong format. So Random numbers have been generated between 150 to 180 inorder to fill data for Heights for each employee. Data has been checked for any Duplictes and such data removal steps has been taken.( But no Duplicates found in actual given data.)

Insights:

Number of employees under each team
Details on employees fall under specific age group, with Minimum and Maximum age for the given Employee List.
The team having the employee drawing highest salary
Correlation between Age and Salary
Data and corresponding Graphic representations are there for each and every insights.

Complete Data after Preporcessing can be viewed in the particular File named - ABC Company Final Data.csv
